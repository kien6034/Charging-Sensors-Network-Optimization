Sensors:
- p: energy consumption rate
- Emax: maximum battery capacity 
- Emin: minimum operation 
- einit: residual energy at beginning of the charging cycle 

MC:
- EMC: max energy capacity 
- PM: energy consumption rate
- U: charging rate 
- V: vel 


Out: 
- charging path is the subset of all sensors 
- correstpodning charging time 

Obj: 
 - minimize: 
    +The number of dead node sensors 
    +Maximum energy reduction of sensors 

Constrains: 
 - Total energy of MC travelling (EMove) and MC charging (Echarge)  <= EMC 
 - Energy sensor level <= Emax  (equa 9)
 - Charging time at each sensor >= 0
